# Covering Maps Visualization

This project provides a visualization of **Covering Maps** in the context of **Algebraic Topology**. It offers insights into the fundamental concepts of covering spaces and their applications.

## Overview

Covering maps are a type of function that "covers" a space by mapping points from a "total space" to a "base space," preserving some of the structure of the space. This project visualizes these concepts, helping you better understand their geometric and topological properties.

## How It Works

- **Code Explanation**: The code uses various mathematical constructs to create visual representations of covering maps.
- **Interactive Visualization**: It allows for a hands-on approach to explore different types of covering maps and their properties.

## Need Help or Further Explanation?
